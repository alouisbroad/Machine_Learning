            "Iraqi MPs responded to the strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence in their country.\n",
            "European leaders have called for all sides to show restraint. \n",

        "12 April 2020\n",
        " \n",
        "The Archbishop of Canterbury has hailed the \"heroism\" of front-line workers during the coronavirus outbreak, as UK churches remain closed over Easter for the first time in hundreds of years. \n",
        "Justin Welby led the first national digital Easter Sunday service from his kitchen at Lambeth Palace.\n",
        "Meanwhile the Archbishop of Westminster has highlighted how faith can be a comfort \"in a time of darkness\". \n",
        "With the UK under lockdown, worshippers are marking the festival from home. \n",
        "It comes as the number of coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals reached 9,875.\n",
        "In a video from his flat in central London Archbishop Welby called for \"a resurrection of our common life\". \n",
        "\"After so much suffering, so much heroism from key workers and the NHS, we cannot be content to go back to what was before as if all is normal,\" he said in the sermon recorded on his iPad.\n",
        "\"There needs to be a resurrection of our common life.\"\n",
        "The service was broadcast live on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday and is available to watch on the Church of England's website and Facebook page. \n",
        "The Archbishop normally presides before a congregation of 1,500 people at Canterbury Cathedral on Easter morning. \n",
        "However, all traditional Easter services have been cancelled to follow the government's rules on social distancing. \n",
        "A message posted from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Twitter account wished the country a happy Easter. \n",
        "\"This year across the country churches will remain closed and families will spend the day apart,\" the message said. \n",
        "\"But by staying home, remember, you are protecting the NHS and saving lives\". \n",
        "Archibishop Welby told a virtual congregation: \"So many people right across the country are anxious about employment, food, are isolated from loved ones and feel that the future looks dark.\" \n",
        "\"People right across the globe feel the same uncertainty, fear, despair and isolation. But you are not alone.\"\n",
        "He added: \"In the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we have a hope that is surer than stone; than any architecture.\n",
        "\"Even in the dark days of this Easter we can feed on hope. We can dream of what our country and our world will look like after the pandemic.\"\n",
        "Meanwhile, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, said the Easter break was a chance to reflect, in a sermon broadcast on 39 BBC local radio stations. \n",
        "\"This time of great testing enables us to distinguish what is truly important from all that is fleetingly desired, and has so often mistakenly been given pride of place in our ambitions,\" he said. \n",
        "\"Already we have to look forward to the rebuilding of our common life.\"\n",
        "Cardinal Nichols also pointed to the Easter story to show that \"death is not the last word\" and to urge families to seek comfort and courage in Jesus Christ. \n",
        "\"So often it seems that death does have the final say, breaking our hearts, especially when the departing one is far from our arms,\" he said. \n",
        "\"Then, as for many today, death is ruthless, uncompromising, hard as rock.\n",
        "\"Today we proclaim another reality: death is not the end. The rock of suffering and death is broken open by the cross of Jesus.\"\n",
        "The Pope will also break with tradition and livestream his Easter Sunday mass from a mostly empty St Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n",
        "In an Easter vigil service on Saturday evening, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church urged people not to \"yield to fear\" over coronavirus, calling on them to be \"messengers of life in a time of death\". \n",
        "It comes after the Queen told the nation \"coronavirus will not overcome us\", in an Easter message on Saturday. \n",
        "Referencing the tradition of lighting candles to mark the occasion, she said: \"As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater.\"\n",

        " \n",
        "No 10 has urged Iraq to allow UK troops to stay in the country following the US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying their work is vital.\n",
        "Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump.\n",
        "Iraqi MPs responded to the strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence in their country.\n",
        "European leaders have called for all sides to show restraint. \n",
        "Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has denied US troops are pulling out of Iraq, after a letter from a US general there suggested a withdrawal.\n",
        "The letter said the US would be \"repositioning forces in the coming days and weeks\" - but Mr Esper said there had been \"no decision whatsoever to leave\".\n",
        "Earlier, Boris Johnson spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi by phone, and a Downing Street spokesman said the leaders had \"agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward\". \n",
        "\"The prime minister underlined the UK's unwavering commitment to Iraq's stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh [the Islamic State group]\". \n",
        "Mr Johnson then chaired a meeting of senior ministers to discuss the deepening crisis. \n",
        "Afterwards, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government's key message was the \"importance of de-escalating the tensions and finding a diplomatic way through this crisis\".\n",
        "He also distanced the UK from the US president's threat that cultural sites in Iran could be targeted, saying: \"We have been clear cultural sites are protected under international law and we would expect that to be respected.\"\n",
        "About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200. \n",
        "Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance's forces had suspended training in Iraq. Only a small number of the UK troops in Iraq are involved in that operation.\n",
        "The Army says that British troops are in the country to provide training and equipment to Iraqi and Kurdish security forces - rather than in a combat role - and have trained more than 25,000 Iraqi forces.\n",
        "Caretaker Iraqi Prime Minister Mr Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving the country, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote.\n",
        "A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group, at the request of the Iraqi government.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to the UK has strongly denied reports in the Times that his country had threatened to kill British troops following the assassination of Soleimani. \n",
        "The paper quotes an unnamed senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard as saying that its forces would \"target US troops in the Middle East without any concern about killing its allies, including UK troops\". \n",
        "But Hamid Baeidinejad described the story as \"provocative\" and a \"vicious lie\" in a Twitter post. \n",
        "\"I will ask the concerned UK authorities to take swift action to stop such malicious false propaganda in this very sensitive time,\" he said. \n",
        "As the Ambassador and high representative of my country in the UK, I strongly condemn the vicious lie and provocative news by #Times today.

        "End of Twitter post  by @baeidinejad\n",

        "Retired army officer Sir Simon Vincent Mayall warned on Radio 4's Today programme that British troops serving in the Middle East could \"possibly\" be killed in retaliation attacks on US soldiers. \n",
        "The Ministry of Defence adviser said western allied troops stationed in neighbouring Iraq were \"joined at the hip\" and that casualties could be shared in Iraq if Iran hits back.\n",
        "In a joint statement issued on Sunday night, Mr Johnson, Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron said the current cycle of violence \"must be stopped\" and called on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation.\n",
        "The three leaders said they were concerned by the \"negative\" role Iran has played in the region but called on \"all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility\".\n",
